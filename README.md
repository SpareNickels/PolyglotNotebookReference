# Introduction 
This repository is meant to serve as an introduction and reference for working with Polyglot Notebooks and .NET Interactive.

Polyglot Notebooks are a powerful tool for combining documentation and interactive code snippets. They enable seamless integration of multiple programming languages within a single notebook, making it easier to demonstrate workflows, teach concepts, and explore solutions in a more engaging and hands-on way.

To show this, I've used a Polyglot Notebook to showcase some of the awesome features available in Polyglot Notebooks!
